# FunWithShapes
: This is a voice-enabled multimodal, interactive application that is specially designed for kids. Through this application,
kids are provided with an entertaining game while educating them about shapes in a fun-filled way. The application has two modules. The "Learn Shape" module plays a short video telling kids about shapes. The "Play Me " module is a small interactive game on shapes.
It is designed for kids 2-3 year old who have started learning about shapes.

The application has been developed using MIT App Inventor tool, which is a free open source software for developing simple voice based applications. We have used original voice recordings and for animations, we have used a free open source tool "Powtoon".

The "App Inventor" tool has some limitations and does not support creation of sophisticated animations. Also, the quality of voice generated did not meet our expectations. Hence we ended up using our own voice for recording.

Also, it increased the volume of the application to a great extent which is causing performance issues at times.

Our future plan is to move the audio and video files to a server and then pre-fetch before its used in the application.
